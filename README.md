# Guli Habibullaeva Portfolio

## Project Description
This is my personal portfolio website. I created this space to share who I am, highlight my projects and experiences, and allow others to reach out to me.  
It’s a reflection of both my work and my personality — clean, expressive, and a little playful (you’ll see the flower cursor I added for fun!).

## Process

### Design & Structure
I started by deciding which sections were important to include — like an intro, projects, and contact.  
I chose a soft, elegant background and a color scheme that felt calming and true to me.

### Development
I built the site using HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript to make it more dynamic.

Some fun features include:
- A flower cursor  
- Responsive design that works well on all devices  
- A simple contact method using my email displayed directly on the page

## Reflection / Evaluation
This project was such a fun and meaningful experience.  
I learned a lot — from playing with cursor effects to experimenting with different ways for users to contact me.  
I initially tried to integrate Formspree and Mailchimp to create a working contact form, but they didn’t quite work out the way I hoped — especially with GitHub Pages.  
So in the end, I decided to keep it simple and just display my email address as text.

Even though it's not a form, users can easily copy my email, which is actually very convenient and straightforward.

I'm really proud of how the website turned out. It feels like me — from the soft background and thoughtful layout to the custom flower cursor.  
I hope it helps people get to know me better and opens the door to new connections.
