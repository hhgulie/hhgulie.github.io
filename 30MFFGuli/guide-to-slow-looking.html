            <b>Once you're ready, follow the steps below to begin your slow looking practice:</b>
            
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Choose Your Focus</strong><br>Pick an object, scene, or piece of art to focus on. It can be anything—a flower, a painting, a tree. The idea is to choose something that grabs your attention and invites deeper exploration.</li>
                <li><strong>Engage with Detail</strong><br>Take a moment to notice the fine details—colors, textures, shapes. Don't rush. Focus on the small things you might normally overlook.</li>
                <li><strong>Breathe and Pause</strong><br>As you look, take deep, slow breaths. Pause between each breath and let yourself absorb the full experience of the object.</li>
                <li><strong>Notice Thoughts and Feelings</strong><br>Let any thoughts or emotions that arise come and go without judgment. Focus on the experience of seeing and being present in the moment.</li>
                <li><strong>Practice Regularly</strong><br>To reap the benefits, make slow looking a part of your routine. Even a few minutes a day can make a big difference in reducing stress and improving your overall sense of well-being.</li>
